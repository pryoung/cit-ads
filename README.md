# cit-ads
IDL software for querying the Astrophysics Data System (ADS) and creating publication lists.

These routines were available in the SolarSoft repository up to around November 2022, but I've moved them to github now. The present version supercedes the SolarSoft version.

Some information about using this software is available at:
